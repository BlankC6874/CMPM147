				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relations to the inspiring image:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Colors:</li>
					<p>	- The color palette is a direct nod to the scene that inspired the project.</p>
					<p>	- The sky’s clear blue, the deep green of the mountains, and the crisp snowy white of the peaks all recreate the natural harmony of alpine vistas.</p>
					<li>Primitives:</li>
					<p> - Basic geometric shapes form the backbone of the design. Ellipses represent the sun and wildflowers, capturing their simplicity and vibrancy.</p>
					<li>Polygons:</li>
					<p> - Custom-shaped polygons (like triangles), drawn using p5.js’s beginShape() and endShape() functions, are used to generate the mountain range.</p>
					<li>Generativity:</li>
					<p> - Each click of the “reimagine” button alters a random seed, producing a unique landscape every time.</p>
					<p> - This randomness injects life and constant variation into the scene, mirroring how natural landscapes are ever-changing and never exactly the same from one moment to the next.</p>
					<li>Life:</li>
					<p> - The sun’s size adjusts responsively to the mouse’s horizontal movement, while wildflowers gently sway in sync with time.</p>
					<p> - These dynamic behaviors transform the scene into a living, breathing piece of art that reacts to both environmental time and audience interaction.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I started with a simple template, and by integrating generative techniques, interactive sun sizing, and dynamic wildflower movement, I transformed it into a piece that feels organic and true to an alpine landscape. No fluff—just a raw, algorithm-driven process that matches nature’s unpredictable beauty. However, there are certain things could be improved like the integration of tops and bodies among the hill/mountain can be more seamless.</p>
