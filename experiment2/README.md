Relation to inspring image:

**Colors:**
  - The color palette is a direct nod to the scene that inspired the project.
  - The sky’s clear blue, the deep green of the mountains, and the crisp snowy white of the peaks all recreate the natural harmony of alpine vistas.

**Primitives:**
  - Basic geometric shapes form the backbone of the design. Ellipses represent the sun and wildflowers, capturing their simplicity and vibrancy.

**Polygons:**
  - Custom-shaped polygons (like triangles), drawn using p5.js’s beginShape() and endShape() functions, are used to generate the mountain range.

**Generativity:**
  - Each click of the “reimagine” button alters a random seed, producing a unique landscape every time.
  - This randomness injects life and constant variation into the scene, mirroring how natural landscapes are ever-changing and never exactly the same from one moment to the next.

**Life:**
  - The sun’s size adjusts responsively to the mouse’s horizontal movement, while wildflowers gently sway in sync with time.
  - These dynamic behaviors transform the scene into a living, breathing piece of art that reacts to both environmental time and audience interaction.
