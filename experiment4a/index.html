				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generating infinite interactive world that is full of Microsoft logos and black and white tiles.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The sketch generates an infinite isometric grid of 32x16 px diamonds seeded by a user-supplied key 
					(hashed to worldSeed for reproducible noise and randomness).
					Every 4x4 block's center 2x2 diamonds form a Microsoft-logo color motif (green, red, yellow, blue) 
					while the rest display a black-and-white chessboard pattern. 
					Each tile individually "floats" up to ±5 px in response to real-time mouse position, 
					color blocks run a synced three-phase glow cycle (red → green+blue → yellow, 
					each glowing for 100 ms with a 1s pause), and clicking any color block triggers a quick 0.5s 
					white flash-using millis() for seamless infinite looping.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I harness the iconic four-color Microsoft logo palette - not as a corporate badge,
					but as building blocks in an infinite, rule-based playground.
					Every 4x4 tile grid hides a perfect 2x2 logo motif: green, red, yellow, and blue diamonds stand tightly together, 
					then dissolve into a classic black-and-white chessboard before the pattern repeats.
					Each color block combined like a canvas gently floats, responding to your mouse movement,
					while an orchestrated glow sequence (red → green+blue → yellow) dances through the grid in a rhythmic cycle.
