**Description**: 
- This dungeon generator carves 3–5 non‑overlapping rectangular rooms out of a pitch‑black backdrop and links them with dedicated corridors so that every room is reachable. 
- Click “reseed” or edit the ASCII map on the fly—your changes show up instantly. 
- It’s fast, lightweight, and perfect for prototyping classic roguelike levels.

**Codes**:
- `#` — Wall (pure black background; no tile drawn)  
- `.` — Room floor (uses stone‑slab tile at coords 2,3)  
- `+` — Corridor floor (uses distinct path tile at coords 1,3) 

**Life**:
- Hover your mouse over any `.` or `+` tile and watch a soft circular glow follow your cursor—like a torch lighting the way in the darkness. 
- Real‑time editing means you can tweak room layouts or corridor shapes in the ASCII box and see the dungeon update at 60 FPS.
