Instead of churning out crappy fantasy quests, my generator would dish out absurd tech support tickets from a dystopian future. Imagine this: every ticket is like a short, brutal story where a hapless user (think “Bro, my AI toaster just started tweeting my breakfast”) complains about malfunctioning tech in a society where gadgets have way too much attitude.
Each output would have:
- **A quirky username:** Something like “CyberSavage99” or “404_Not_Found”.
- **A bizarre error message:** Picture a sentient fridge that gives existential advice or an overworked robot butler complaining about being stuck in endless software updates.
- **A deadpan, brutally honest support response:** Not your typical “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” but more like “Yeah, your device’s existential crisis isn’t fixable with duct tape, fam.”
